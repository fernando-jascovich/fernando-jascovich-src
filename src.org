I'm Fernando Jascovich and this is my personal website, a little space for blogging and sharing some stuff, mostly geeky things related (somehow) to programming.

I have a very close relationship with computers, spending the majority of my daily hours in front of one of them. Since I have memories I can recall being next to a computer, interacting with a computer. Right now I am having a really good time working everyday as a software developer. I had been lucky enough to find a job that I love.

I hope that some of the contents available here will be useful somehow to someone at sometime. Be my guest.

I got published my first package to [Melpa](https://melpa.org/#/android-env).

[android-env](https://github.com/fernando-jascovich/android-env.el) is a helper for those eager to do Android using Emacs. I know, is not the mainstream way to do it, but Emacs is my home.

Is a tiny little thing but it really helps me on my daily work. Thanks to [Chris Rayner](https://github.com/riscy) and [Steve Purcell](https://github.com/purcell) for being so helpful and guiding me into know a little about elisp standards.

PR on melpa: [PR #6084](https://github.com/melpa/melpa/pull/6084).
