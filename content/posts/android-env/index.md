I got published my first package to [Melpa](<https://melpa.org/#/android-env>).

[android-env](<https://github.com/fernando-jascovich/android-env.el>) is a helper for those eager to do Android using Emacs. I know, is not the mainstream way to do it, but Emacs is my home.

Is a tiny little thing but it really helps me on my daily work. Thanks to [Chris Rayner](<https://github.com/riscy>) and [Steve Purcell](<https://github.com/purcell>) for being so helpful and guiding me into know a little about elisp standards.
