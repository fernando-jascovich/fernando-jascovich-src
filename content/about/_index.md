I'm Fernando Jascovich and this is my personal website, a little space for blogging and sharing some stuff, mostly geeky things related (somehow) to programming.

I have a very close relationship with computers, spending the majority of my daily hours in front of one of them. Since I have memories I can recall being next to a computer, interacting with a computer. Right now I am having a really good time working everyday as a software developer. I had been lucky enough to find a job that I love.

I hope that some of the contents available here will be useful somehow to someone at sometime. Be my guest.
